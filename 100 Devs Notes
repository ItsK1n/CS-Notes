Class 01 - 100 Devs
- When it comes to getting a job as a Software Developer
  the most important factor is the networking and the way
  that you apply to jobs rather than your raw coding ability.
  So just learning to code is not enough to get a job as a
  Software Developer.

- The three important things in order to succeed:
1. Manage Frustration
2. Consistency - Spread your work load over each day for a certaint amount of hours not 10 hours in a day 1-2 hours a day is better than 10 hours for one day
3. Taking Care Of Yourself - Most people burnout so make sure you don't overwork yourself, sleep, eating right, exercise 

- Learning How to Learn
1. Active Recall - Recall the things you have just read. Stop at an end of paragraph or page and talk to yourself on what you just learned
2. Spaced Repetition

- What is a study practice tha enables me to do a quarter of the work yet yielding better results?

- What is the internet?
- A Client side device is what we use to access the internet so phones, laptops, computers and we use to consume
- A Server side device it servers different kinds of contents like HTML, Javascript, CSS

- What is full stack development?
- These guys focus on both front end and back end developer

- What is HTML5?
- It is the fifth version of HTML which introduced new features in the browser video, audio, canvas, geolocation, and websockets

- The Golden Rule
1. HTML - Content/Structure
2. CSS - Style
3. JS - Behavior/Interactions
- Keep these seperate as it is easier to read and for organization
