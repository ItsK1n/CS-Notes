Hello,
This is my journey of learning how to become a Software Engineer.

Class 01 - 100 Devs
- When it comes to getting a job as a Software Developer
  the most important factor is the networking and the way
  that you apply to jobs rather than your raw coding ability.
  So just learning to code is not enough to get a job as a
  Software Developer.
- The three important things in order to succeed is to
1. Manage Frustration
2. Consistency - Spread your work load over each day for a certaint amount of hours not 10 hours in a day 1-2 hours a day is better than 10 hours for one day
3. Taking Care Of Yourself - Most people burnout so make sure you don't overwork yourself, sleep, eating right, exercise
